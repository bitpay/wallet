Secure bitcoin on your own terms with an open source, multisignature wallet from BitPay. 
Copay users can hold funds individually or share finances securely with other users with multisignature wallets, which prevent unauthorized payments by requiring multiple approvals. Here are some ways Copay can be used with others:

To save for vacations or joint purchases with friends 
To track family spending and allowances
可用来管理商务，团体，或集团的收支

Multiple wallet creation and management in-app 
Intuitive multisignature security for personal or shared wallets

Hierarchical deterministic (HD) address generation and wallet backups 
Device-based security: all private keys are stored locally, not in the cloud
