Secure nav coin on your own terms with an open source, multisignature wallet from NavPay. 
Navpay users can hold funds individually or share finances securely with other users with multisignature wallets, which prevent unauthorized payments by requiring multiple approvals. Here are some ways Navpay can be used with others:

To save for vacations or joint purchases with friends
