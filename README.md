## Testing in a Browser

> **Note:** This method should only be used for development purposes. When running Bitpay Wallet in a normal browser environment, browser extensions and other malicious code might have access to internal data and private keys. For production use, see the latest official [releases](https://github.com/bitpay/wallet/releases/).

Clone the repo and open the directory:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/bitpay/wallet.git
cd wallet
```

Ensure you have [Node](https://nodejs.org/) installed, then install and start Wallet:

```sh
npm install
npm run apply:bitpay
npm run start
```

Visit [`localhost:8100`](http://localhost:8100/) to view the app.

## Unit & E2E Tests (Karma & Protractor)

To run the tests, run:

```
 npm run test
```

## Testing on Real Devices

It's recommended that all final testing be done on a real device â€“ both to assess performance and to enable features that are unavailable to the emulator (e.g. a device camera).

### Android

Follow the [Cordova Android Platform Guide](https://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/latest/guide/platforms/android/) to set up your development environment.

When your development environment is ready, run the `start:android` package script.

```sh
npm run apply:bitpay
npm run prepare:bitpay
npm run start:android
```

### iOS

Follow the [Cordova iOS Platform Guide](https://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/latest/guide/platforms/ios/) to set up your development environment.

When your development environment is ready, run the `start:ios` package script.

```sh
npm run apply:bitpay
npm run prepare:bitpay
npm run start:ios
```

### Desktop (Linux, macOS, and Windows)

The desktop version of Bitpay Wallet currently uses Electron. To get started, first install Electron on your system from [the Electron website](https://electronjs.org/).

When Electron is installed, run the `start:desktop` package script.

```sh
npm run apply:wallet
npm run start:desktop
```

## Build Bitpay Wallet App Bundles

Before building the release version for a platform, run the `clean-all` command to delete any untracked files in your current working directory. (Be sure to stash any uncommitted changes you've made.) This guarantees consistency across builds for the current state of this repository.

You still need to follow the [Cordova Android Platform Guide](https://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/latest/guide/platforms/android/) to set up your development environment. Specifically, you will need to set the `ANDROID_HOME` environment variable, include the Android SDK's tools, tools/bin, and platform-tools directories to your PATH:
```
export ANDROID_HOME=/Development/android-sdk
export PATH=${PATH}:/Development/android-sdk/platform-tools:/Development/android-sdk/tools
```

You may also need to install `gradle` independently in your distribution (e.g. `sudo apt install gradle` for Ubuntu).

The `final` commands build the production version of the app, and bundle it with the release version of the platform being built. The build will fail if no `copay.keystore` in the `..\copay` directory is provided. Produce a new android keystore named `copay.keystore` and include a signed key named `copay_play` to finish the build.


### Android

```sh
npm run clean-all
npm install
npm run apply:bitpay
npm run prepare:bitpay
npm run final:android

BITPAY_EXTERNAL_SERVICES_CONFIG_LOCATION="~/.bitpay/externalServices.json" npm run apply:bitpay
```

## About Bitpay Wallet

### General

Bitpay Wallet (formerly Copay) implements a multisig wallet using [p2sh](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Pay_to_script_hash) addresses. It supports multiple wallets, each with its own configuration, such as 3-of-5 (3 required signatures from 5 participant peers) or 2-of-3. To create a multisig wallet shared between multiple participants, Bitpay Wallet requires the extended public keys of all the wallet participants. Those public keys are then incorporated into the wallet configuration and combined to generate a payment address where funds can be sent into the wallet. Conversely, each participant manages their own private key and that private key is never transmitted anywhere.

To unlock a payment and spend the wallet's funds, a quorum of participant signatures must be collected and assembled in the transaction. The funds cannot be spent without at least the minimum number of signatures required by the wallet configuration (2-of-3, 3-of-5, 6-of-6, etc.). Once a transaction proposal is created, the proposal is distributed among the wallet participants for each to sign the transaction locally. Finally, when the transaction is signed, the last signing participant will broadcast the transaction to the Bitcoin network.

Bitpay Wallet also implements [BIP32](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0032.mediawiki) to generate new addresses for peers. The public key that each participant contributes to the wallet is a BIP32 extended public key. As additional public keys are needed for wallet operations (to produce new addresses to receive payments into the wallet, for example) new public keys can be derived from the participants' original extended public keys. Once again, it's important to stress that each participant keeps their own private keys locally - private keys are not shared - and are used to sign transaction proposals to make payments from the shared wallet.

For more information regarding how addresses are generated using this procedure, see: [Structure for Deterministic P2SH Multisignature Wallets](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0045.mediawiki).

## Bitpay Wallet Backups and Recovery

Since v1.2 Bitpay Wallet uses BIP39 mnemonics for backing up wallets. The BIP44 standard is used for wallet address derivation. Multisig wallets use P2SH addresses, while non-multisig wallets use P2PKH.

Information about backup and recovery procedures is available at: https://github.com/bitpay/wallet/blob/master/backupRecovery.md

Previous versions of Bitpay Wallet used files as backups. See the following section.

It is possible to recover funds from a Bitpay Wallet Wallet without using Bitpay Wallet or the Wallet Service, check the [Copay Recovery Tool](https://github.com/bitpay/copay-recovery/tree/master).

## Wallet Export Format

Bitpay Wallet encrypts the backup with the [Stanford JS Crypto Library](http://bitwiseshiftleft.github.io/sjcl/). To extract the private key of your wallet you can go to settings, choose your wallet, click in "more options", then "wallet information", scroll to the bottom and click in "Extended Private Key". That information is enough to sign any transaction from your wallet, so be careful when handling it!

The backup also contains the key `publicKeyRing` that holds the extended public keys of the Copayers.
Depending on the key `derivationStrategy`, addresses are derived using
[BIP44](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0044.mediawiki) or [BIP45](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0045.mediawiki). Wallets created in Copay v1.2 and forward always use BIP44, all previous wallets use BIP45. Also note that since Copay version v1.2, non-multisig wallets use address types Pay-to-PublicKeyHash (P2PKH) while multisig wallets still use Pay-to-ScriptHash (P2SH) (key `addressType` at the backup):

| Copay Version | Wallet Type               | Derivation Strategy | Address Type |
| ------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------- | ------------ |
| <1.2          | All                       | BIP45               | P2SH         |
| â‰¥1.2          | Non-multisig              | BIP44               | P2PKH        |
| â‰¥1.2          | Multisig                  | BIP44               | P2SH         |
| â‰¥1.5          | Multisig Hardware wallets | BIP44 (root m/48â€™)  | P2SH         |

Using a tool like [Bitcore PlayGround](http://bitcore.io/playground) all wallet addresses can be generated. (TIP: Use the `Address` section for P2PKH address type wallets and `Multisig Address` for P2SH address type wallets). For multisig addresses, the required number of signatures (key `m` on the export) is also needed to recreate the addresses.

BIP45 note: All addresses generated at BWS with BIP45 use the 'shared cosigner index' (2147483647) so Copay address indexes look like: `m/45'/2147483647/0/x` for main addresses and `m/45'/2147483647/1/y` for change addresses.

Since version 1.5, Copay uses the root `m/48'` for hardware multisignature wallets. This was coordinated with Ledger and Trezor teams. While the derivation path format is still similar to BIP44, the root was in order to indicate that these wallets are not discoverable by scanning addresses for funds. Address generation for multisignature wallets requires the other copayers extended public keys.

## Bitcore Wallet Service

Bitpay Wallet depends on [Bitcore Wallet Service](https://github.com/bitpay/bitcore-wallet-service) (BWS) for blockchain information, networking and Copayer synchronization. A BWS instance can be setup and operational within minutes or you can use a public instance like `https://bws.bitpay.com`. Switching between BWS instances is very simple and can be done with a click from within Bitpay Wallet. BWS also allows Bitpay Wallet to interoperate with other wallets like [Bitcore Wallet CLI](https://github.com/bitpay/bitcore-wallet).

Please note that Bitpay Wallet v5.3.0 and above use CSP to restrict network access. To use a custom BWS see [CSP announcement](https://github.com/bitpay/copay/blob/master/CSP.md).

## Release Schedules

Bitpay Wallet uses the `MAJOR.MINOR.BATCH` convention for versioning. Any release that adds features should modify the MINOR or MAJOR number.

### Bug Fixing Releases

We release bug fixes as soon as possible for all platforms. Usually around a week after patches, a new release is made with language translation updates (like 1.1.4 and then 1.1.5). There is no coordination so all platforms are updated at the same time.

### Minor and Major Releases

- t+0: tag the release 1.2 and "text lock" (meaning only non-text related bug fixes. Though this rule is sometimes broken, it's good to make a rule.)
- t+7: testing for 1.2 is finished, translation is also finished, and 1.2.1 is tagged with all translations along with bug fixes made in the last week.
- t+7: iOS is submitted for 1.2.1. All other platforms are submitted with auto-release off.
- t + (~17): All platforms 1.2.1 are released when Apple approves the iOS application update.
