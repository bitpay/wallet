Secure bitcoin on your own terms with an open source, multisignature wallet from BitPay. 
Copay users can hold funds individually or share finances securely with other users with multisignature wallets, which prevent unauthorized payments by requiring multiple approvals. Here are some ways Copay can be used with others:

To save for vacations or joint purchases with friends 
To track family spending and allowances
To manage business, club, or organization funds and expenses

We built the following features into this version of Copay for a bitcoin wallet that doesn't compromise on security or accessibility:

Multiple wallet creation and management in-app 
Intuitive multisignature security for personal or shared wallets
Easy spending proposal flow for shared wallets and group payments
Hierarchical deterministic (HD) address generation and wallet backups 
Device-based security: all private keys are stored locally, not in the cloud
Support for Bitcoin testnet wallets
Synchronous access across all major mobile and desktop platforms
Payment protocol (BIP70-BIP73) support: easily-identifiable payment requests and verifiably secure bitcoin payments
Support for 150+ currency pricing options and unit denomination in BTC or bits
Email notifications for payments and transfers
Customizable wallet naming and background colors
4 supported languages (EN, JP, FR, ES)

Copay is free and open source software run on non-proprietary servers, so there's no need to rely on any company for continuous support. Anyone can review or contribute to Copay's source code on GitHub (https://github.com/bitpay/copay).
